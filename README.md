# Play-Sound-in-Cpp
this program used to play sound music or everything you need to play in console ... but the file to play type (.wav) only .... not mp3 or etc  ... if you need to help just tell me.. :)



Make sure to put the song in a folder (depug) with the same name, and the song type is wav. The program does not accept mp3 or any other type, so you only use a wav file, the name of the song in the code is the same as the name of the song in the file



```
If you are using code blocks, there are things you must do: From the settings, go to the compiler and a window will appear with a set of commands, choose the Linker Settings command and choose Add, then choose the name of the library Libwinmm or winmm.lib from MinGw File
```
